-- Day 6
-- Topics: GROUP BY, aggregating by categories

-- 1. Count the number of patients by each service.
SELECT service, COUNT(*) AS total_patients FROM patients GROUP BY service ORDER BY total_patients DESC;

-- 2. Calculate the average age of patients grouped by service.
SELECT service, ROUND(AVG(age),1) AS average_age FROM patients GROUP BY service ORDER BY average_age DESC;

-- 3. Find the total number of staff members per role.
SELECT role, COUNT(staff_id) AS total_staff_members FROM staff GROUP BY role ORDER BY total_staff_members DESC;

### Daily Challenge:
-- Question: For each hospital service, calculate the total number of patients admitted, total patients refused, and 
-- the admission rate (percentage of requests that were admitted). Order by admission rate descending.
SELECT service, SUM(patients_admitted) AS total_patients_admitted, SUM(patients_refused) AS total_patients_refused,
ROUND((SUM(patients_admitted) * 100.0) / (SUM(patients_admitted) + SUM(patients_refused)), 2
) AS admission_rate_percentage FROM services_weekly GROUP BY service ORDER BY admission_rate_percentage DESC;
