-- 1. Find all weeks in services_weekly where no special event occurred.
SELECT week, event FROM services_weekly WHERE event = 'none' OR event IS NULL;

-- 2. Count how many records have null or empty event values.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_or_empty_event_count FROM services_weekly WHERE event IS NULL OR event = 'none' OR event = '';

-- 3. List all services that had at least one week with a special event.
SELECT DISTINCT service FROM services_weekly WHERE event IS NOT NULL AND event <> 'none' AND event <> '';

-- ## Daily Challenge:
-- Question: Analyze the event impact by comparing weeks with events vs weeks without events. Show: event status ('With Event' or 'No Event'), 
-- count of weeks, average patient satisfaction, and average staff morale. Order by average patient satisfaction descending.
SELECT
CASE 
	WHEN event IS NULL OR event = 'none' THEN 'No Event'
	ELSE 'With Event'
    END AS event_status,

ROUND(AVG(staff_morale), 2) AS avg_staff_morale  FROM services_weekly GROUP BY event_status ORDER BY avg_patient_satisfaction DESC;
